Anaconda.
An anaconda'" is a large, non-venomous snake found in tropical South America. Although the name actually applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species in particular, the common or green anaconda, "Eunectes murinus", which is one of the largest snakes in the world.
Etymology.
Various theories exist regarding the origin of the name itself. The most widely accepted one suggests it was derived from the Sinhala "henakandaya" since the phonetic sounds are very similar. However, this name is used to refer to the brown vine snake, "Ahaetulla pulverulenta", a slender, arboreal species that grows to five feet (152 cm) at most and feeds only on small vertebrates. Another theory by Yule and Burnell (1886) is based on an entry in the Catalogue of Indian Serpents from the Leyden Museum (Ray, 1693) that reads: "Anacondaia Zeylonensibus, id est Bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens", meaning "the anacondaia of the Ceylonese, i.e. he that constricts the limbs of buffaloes and yoke beasts." Without a clear Sinhala connection, they suggest one from the Tamil language instead: "anai-kondra" ("anaik-konda"), meaning "which killed an elephant.” Per National Geographic, the word "anaconda" comes from the Tamil word "anaikolra", which means "elephant killer".
The name was first used in the English language in 1768 by V. Jonasson in a colorful description of a large snake found in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), most likely a reticulated python, "Python reticulatus". The account, which explains how the snake constricts and devours tigers, is full of popular misconceptions, but was much read at the time, and so gave rise to the myth of the anaconda of Ceylon.
