Ahmed II.
Ahmed II Khan Ghazi'" (Ottoman Turkish: احمد ثانى "Aḥmed-i sānī") (February 25, 1643 – February 6, 1695) was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1691 to 1695. Ahmed II was born at Topkapı Palace, Constantinople, the son of Sultan Ibrahim (1640–48) by Valide Sultan Khadija Muazzez, and succeeded his brother Suleiman II (1687–91) in 1691.
Reign.
Ahmed II's best known act was to confirm Mustafa Köprülü as grand vizier. Only a few weeks after his accession the Ottoman Empire sustained a crushing defeat at the Battle of Slankamen from the Austrians under Margrave Louis William of Baden and was driven from Hungary. During the four years of his reign disaster followed on disaster, and in 1695 Ahmed II died at Edirne Palace, worn out by disease and sorrow.
