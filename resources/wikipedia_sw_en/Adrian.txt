Adrian.
Adrian'" is a form of the Latin given name "Hadrianus" (see Hadrian). Several saints and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, Adrian IV, and the only Dutch pope, Adrian VI. As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages, though it was not popular until modern times.
