Affirming the consequent.
Affirming the consequent'", sometimes called "'converse error'" or "'fallacy of the converse'", is a formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement. The corresponding argument has the general form:
An argument of this form is invalid, i.e., the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true. Since "P" was never asserted as the "only" sufficient condition for "Q", other factors could account for "Q" (while "P" was false).
To put it differently, if "P" implies "Q", the only'" inference that can be made is "non-Q" implies "non-P". ("Non-P" and "non-Q" designate the opposite propositions to "P" and "Q".) Symbolically:
The name "affirming the consequent" derives from the premise "Q", which affirms the "then" clause of the conditional premise.
Examples.
One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion. For example:
Owning Fort Knox is not the "only" way to be rich. Any number of other ways exist to be rich.
However, one can affirm with certainty that "if Bill Gates is not rich" ("non-Q") then "Bill Gates does not own Fort Knox" ("non-P")
Arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example:
But having the flu is not the "only" cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat, such as the common cold or strep throat.
