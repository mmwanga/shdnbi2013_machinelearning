Alger of Liège.
Alger of Liège'" (1055–1131), known also as Alger of Cluny and Algerus Magister, was a learned clergyman from Liège who lived in the first half of the 12th century.
He was first deacon of church of St Bartholomew in his native Liège and was then appointed (c. 1100) to St. Lambert's Cathedral. He declined offers from German bishops and finally retired to the monastery of Cluny, where he died at a high age, leaving behind a solid reputation for piety and intelligence.
His "History of the Church of Liège", and many of his other works, are lost. The most important remining are:
See Migne, "Patrol Ser. Lat." vol. clxxx. coll. 739-.972; Herzog-Hauck, "Realencyk. für prot. Theol.," art. by SM Deutsch.
